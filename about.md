    <h4>Security BSides</h4>
    <p>Security BSides is a global, non-profit organization that exists to facilitate the creation of local information security conferences. These conferences are ideally organized by locals, and feature local presenters. Unlike other conferences, BSides events are low-cost, relaxed, and inclusive and attempt to encourage interaction amongst organizers, speakers, and attendees.</p>

    <h4>BSides Winnipeg</h4>
    <p>BSides Winnipeg is one of the many local BSides events found around the world. It was first held in 2013, where speakers presented to a sold-out venue over the course of a weekend. A second event was held in 2015, selling out as well. All presentations from previous years can be found in our archive.</p>

    <h4>Participating</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions about how to participate in the event, either as a <a href="/speakers/">speaker</a> or a <a href="/sponsors/">sponsor</a>, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
